# Blur Faces Of Individuals Present In a Video

Hi my name is `Moses Daudu` 

In this repo, You will see how to blur the faces of people within any video.
I didn't make use of any model, instead I used the `cvzone face detector module` which can correctly detect faces within an image or video

## Step 1:
move to the directory where the files are, then run the following codes
#### Install all requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
#### Run the `main.py` file
`python main.py`

Contact Moses at `mosesdaudu001@gmail.com` for adjustments to suit your needs.

### Potential Future Improvements
I would like to include a functionality that allows it to work on videos as well with better accuracy. However, this would mean getting a better model that is custom to faces even in blurry situations.
